### Obtaining the Dify Plugin Development Package

[Dify Plugin CLI](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugin-daemon/releases)

#### Installation Methods for Different Platforms

**macOS [Brew](https://github.com/langgenius/homebrew-dify) (Global Installation):**

```bash
brew tap langgenius/dify
brew install dify
```

After installation, open a new terminal window and enter the `dify version` command. If it outputs the version information, the installation was successful.

**macOS ARM (M Series Chips):**

```bash
# Download dify-plugin-darwin-arm64
chmod +x dify-plugin-darwin-arm64
./dify-plugin-darwin-arm64 version
```

**macOS Intel:**

```bash
# Download dify-plugin-darwin-amd64
chmod +x dify-plugin-darwin-amd64
./dify-plugin-darwin-amd64 version
```

**Linux:**

```bash
# Download dify-plugin-linux-amd64
chmod +x dify-plugin-linux-amd64
./dify-plugin-linux-amd64 version
```

**Global Installation (Recommended):**

```bash
# Rename and move to system path
# Example (macOS ARM)
mv dify-plugin-darwin-arm64 dify
sudo mv dify /usr/local/bin/
dify version
```

### Running the Development Package

Here we use `dify` as an example. If you are using a local installation method, please replace the command accordingly, for example `./dify-plugin-darwin-arm64 plugin init`.

### Plugin Development Process
