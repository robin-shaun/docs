description: This document introduces how to use Dify's remote debugging feature to
  test plugins. It provides detailed instructions on obtaining debugging information,
  configuring environment variable files, starting plugin remote debugging, and verifying
  plugin installation status. Through this method, developers can test plugins in
  the Dify environment in real-time while developing locally.

After completing plugin development, the next step is to test whether the plugin can function properly. Dify provides a convenient remote debugging method to help you quickly verify plugin functionality in a test environment.

Go to the ["Plugin Management"](https://cloud.dify.ai/plugins) page to obtain the remote server address and debugging Key.

Return to the plugin project, copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`, then fill in the remote server address and debugging Key information you obtained.

`.env` file:

```bash
INSTALL_METHOD=remote
REMOTE_INSTALL_HOST=remote
REMOTE_INSTALL_PORT=5003
REMOTE_INSTALL_KEY=****-****-****-****-****
```

Run the `python -m main` command to start the plugin. On the plugins page, you can see that the plugin has been installed in the Workspace, and other members of the team can also access the plugin.
