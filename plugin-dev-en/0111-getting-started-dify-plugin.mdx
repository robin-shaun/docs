Hello! We're delighted that you're interested in building Dify plugins. This developer documentation center is your core resource, designed to help you learn, create, debug, publish, and manage Dify plugins.

**What are Dify Plugins?**

You can think of Dify plugins as modular components that give AI applications **enhanced perception and execution capabilities**. They make it possible to integrate external services, custom functions, and specialized tools into AI applications built with Dify in a "plug-and-play" manner. Through plugins, your AI applications can better "see," "hear," "speak," "draw," "calculate," "reason," connect to external APIs, and even perform real-world actions.

As a **plugin developer**, you can build exclusive functional extensions for your own Dify applications, or contribute your innovations to the entire Dify ecosystem, benefiting more users.

**In this developer documentation, you will find:**

This documentation aims to provide clear guidance for plugin developers, whether you're a first-time experimenter or seeking advanced customization:

-   **[Quick Start](/plugin-dev-en/0211-getting-started-dify-tool):** Learn the basic concepts of the Dify plugin system, understand its core architecture, and quickly set up your development environment to build your first "Hello World" plugin.
-   **[Core Concepts](/plugin-dev-en/0131-cheatsheet):** Gain a deep understanding of key principles such as plugin lifecycle, security model, Endpoint Integration, Reverse Call, persistent storage, and more.
-   **Developing Different Types of Plugins:** Specific development guides for each plugin type:
    -   **[Models](/plugin-dev-en/0211-getting-started-new-model):** Learn how to package, configure, and manage different AI models as plugins.
    -   **[Tools](/plugin-dev-en/0211-getting-started-dify-tool):** Build specialized capabilities for Agents and workflows, such as data analysis, content processing, custom integrations, and more.
    -   **[Agent Strategies](/plugin-dev-en/9433-agent-strategy-plugin):** Create custom reasoning strategies (like ReAct, CoT, ToT) to empower autonomous Agents in Dify.
    -   **[Extensions](/plugin-dev-en/9231-extension-plugin):** Implement integration with external services through HTTP Webhooks to handle complex logic.
    -   **[Bundles](/plugin-dev-en/9241-bundle):** Learn how to combine multiple plugins into packages for easy distribution and deployment.
-   **[Development and Debugging](/plugin-dev-en/0411-remote-debug-a-plugin):** Master the tools and techniques for efficient plugin development, including using the SDK, leveraging our friendly remote debugging features, and testing your plugins.
