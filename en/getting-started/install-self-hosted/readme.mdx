### Contributing

To maintain code quality, we require all code contributions - even from those with direct commit access - to be submitted as pull requests. These must be reviewed and approved by the core development team before merging.

We welcome contributions from everyone! If you're interested in helping, please check our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/langgenius/dify/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING) for more information on getting started.
