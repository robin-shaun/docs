#### 2. What changes will occur to the team's available resources after upgrading the subscription plan?

| [Marked replies](https://docs.dify.ai/guides/biao-zhu/logs) for applications | 10        | 2000           | 5000            |
| Document uploads for knowledge base                                          | 50        | 500            | 1000            |

Note:

* When upgrading from Free to Professional, all resources are increased as shown in the table.
* When upgrading from Professional to Team, resources are further expanded, with some becoming unlimited.

After upgrading the subscription plan:

* The OpenAI conversation quota will be reset to the new limit for the current billing cycle.
* Previously used computational resources (e.g., vector space usage, document uploads) will not be reset or removed.

#### 3. What if I forget to renew subscription on time?

If you forget to renew your subscription, the team will automatically downgrade to the Sandbox/Free version. Except for the team owner, others will not be able to continue accessing the team. Excess computational resources within the team (such as documents, vector space, etc.) will also be locked.

#### 4. Will deleting the team owner's account affect the team?

A team needs to be bound to one team owner. If the team ownership is not transferred to another team member in time, all data of the current team will be deleted along with the owner's account.

#### 5. What are the differences between the subscription versions?
