## Knowledge Base Management

> The knowledge base page is accessible only to the team owner, team administrators, and users with editor permissions.

On the Dify team homepage, click the "Knowledge Base" tab at the top, select the knowledge base you want to manage, then click **Settings** in the left navigation panel to make adjustments. You can modify the knowledge base name, description, visibility permissions, indexing mode, embedding model, and retrieval settings.

**Knowledge Base Name**: Used to distinguish among different knowledge bases.

**Knowledge Description**: Used to describe the information represented by the documents in the knowledge base.

**Visibility Permissions**: Defines access control for the knowledge base with three levels:

1. **"Only Me"**: Restricts access to the knowledge base owner.
2. **"All team members"**: Grants access to every member of the team.
3. **"Partial team members"**: Allows selective access to specific team members.

Users without appropriate permissions cannot access the knowledge base. When granting access to team members (options 2 or 3), authorized users receive full permissions, including view, edit, and delete rights for the knowledge base content.

**Indexing Mode**: For detailed explanations, please [refer to the documentation](https://docs.dify.ai/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents#5-indexing-method).

**Embedding Model**: Allows you to modify the embedding model for the knowledge base. Changing the embedding model will re-embed all documents in the knowledge base, and the original embeddings will be deleted.

**Retrieval Settings**: For detailed explanations, please [refer to the documentation](https://docs.dify.ai/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents#6-retrieval-settings).
