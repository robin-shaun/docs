title: Variables
version: 'English'
---

Workflow and Chatflow type applications are composed of independent nodes. Most nodes have input and output items, but the input information for each node varies, and the outputs from different nodes also differ.

How can we use a fixed symbol to **represent dynamically changing content?** Variables, acting as dynamic data containers, can store and transmit variable content, being referenced across different nodes to achieve flexible communication of information between nodes.

### **System Variables**

System variables are system-level parameters preset in Chatflow / Workflow applications that can be globally read by other nodes. System-level variables all begin with `sys`.

#### Workflow

Workflow type applications provide the following system variables:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="193">Variable Name</th>
      <th width="116">Data Type</th>
      <th width="278">Description</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><p><code>sys.files</code></p><p><code>[LEGACY]</code></p></td>
      <td>Array[File]</td>
      <td>File parameter, stores images uploaded by users when initially using the application</td>
      <td>Image upload feature needs to be enabled in "Features" at the top right of the application configuration page</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>sys.user_id</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>User ID, system automatically assigns a unique identifier to each user when using the workflow application to distinguish different conversation users</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>sys.app_id</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Application ID, system assigns a unique identifier to each Workflow application to distinguish different applications and record basic information of the current application through this parameter</td>
      <td>For users with development capabilities to distinguish and locate different Workflow applications using this parameter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>sys.workflow_id</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Workflow ID, used to record all node information contained in the current Workflow application</td>
      <td>For users with development capabilities to track and record node information within the Workflow</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>sys.workflow_run_id</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Workflow application run ID, used to record the running status of the Workflow application</td>
      <td>For users with development capabilities to track application run history</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### Chatflow

Chatflow type applications provide the following system variables:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Variable Name</th>
      <th width="127">Data Type</th>
      <th width="283">Description</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>sys.query</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Initial content entered by users in the dialogue box</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>sys.files</code></td>
      <td>Array[File]</td>
      <td>Images uploaded by users in the dialogue box</td>
      <td>Image upload feature needs to be enabled in "Features" at the top right of the application configuration page</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>sys.dialogue_count</code></td>
      <td>Number</td>
      <td><p>Number of conversation rounds when users interact with Chatflow type applications. Count automatically increases by 1 after each round of dialogue, can be combined with if-else nodes for rich branching logic.</p><p>For example, reviewing and analyzing conversation history at round X</p></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>sys.conversation_id</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Unique identifier for dialogue interaction sessions, grouping all related messages into the same conversation, ensuring LLM maintains continuous dialogue on the same topic and context</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>sys.user_id</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Unique identifier assigned to each application user to distinguish different conversation users</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>sys.app_id</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Application ID, system assigns a unique identifier to each Workflow application to distinguish different applications and record basic information of the current application through this parameter</td>
      <td>For users with development capabilities to distinguish and locate different Workflow applications using this parameter</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>sys.workflow_id</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Workflow ID, used to record all node information contained in the current Workflow application</td>
      <td>For users with development capabilities to track and record node information within the Workflow</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>sys.workflow_run_id</code></td>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Workflow application run ID, used to record the running status of the Workflow application</td>
      <td>For users with development capabilities to track application run history</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Environment Variables

**Environment variables are used to protect sensitive information involved in workflows**, such as API keys and database passwords used when running workflows. They are stored in the workflow rather than in the code to facilitate sharing across different environments.

The following three data types are supported:

* String
* Number
* Secret

Environment variables have the following characteristics:

* Environment variables can be globally referenced in most nodes
* Environment variable names cannot be duplicated
* Environment variables are read-only and cannot be written to

### Conversation Variables

> Conversation variables are designed for multi-round conversation scenarios. Since Workflow type applications have linear and independent interactions without multiple conversation exchanges, conversation variables are only applicable to Chatflow type (Chat Assistant â†’ Workflow Orchestration) applications.

**Conversation variables allow application developers to specify particular information that needs to be temporarily stored within the same Chatflow session, ensuring this information can be referenced across multiple rounds of dialogue within the current workflow**. This includes context, files uploaded to the dialogue box (coming soon), and user preferences input during conversations. It's like providing LLM with a "memo" that can be checked at any time, avoiding information discrepancies due to LLM memory errors.

For example, you can store the language preference input by users in the first round of conversation in conversation variables, and LLM will reference this information when responding and use the specified language to reply to users in subsequent conversations.

**Conversation variables** support the following six data types:

* String
* Number
* Object
* Array[string]
* Array[number]
* Array[object]

**Conversation variables** have the following characteristics:

* Conversation variables can be globally referenced in most nodes
* Writing to conversation variables requires using the [Variable Assigner](./nodes/variable-assigner) node
* Conversation variables are readable and writable

For more details about how to use conversation variables with variable assigner nodes, please refer to the [Variable Assigner](./nodes/variable-assigner) node documentation.

### Notes

* To avoid variable name duplication, node names cannot be duplicated
* Node output variables are generally fixed variables and cannot be edited
