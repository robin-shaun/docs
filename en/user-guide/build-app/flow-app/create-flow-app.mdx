## Chatflow

**Use Cases:**

Suitable for conversational scenarios, including customer service, semantic search, and other dialogue-based applications that require multiple logical steps when constructing responses. The distinctive feature of this type of application is its support for multi-round conversational interactions with generated results, allowing for adjustment of the generated content.

Common interaction path: Give instructions → Generate content → Multiple discussions about the content → Regenerate results → End.

On the "Studio" page, click "Create Blank Application" on the left, then select "Workflow Orchestration" under "Chat Assistant."

Common interaction path: Give instructions → Generate content → End

On the "Studio" page, click "Create Blank Application" on the left, then select "Workflow" to complete the creation.

## Differences Between the Two Application Type

1. The End node belongs to Workflow as a termination node and can only be selected at the end of the process.
2. The Answer node belongs to Chatflow, used for streaming text content output and supports output during intermediate steps of the process.
3. Chatflow has built-in chat memory (Memory) for storing and transmitting historical messages from multiple rounds of conversation, which can be enabled in LLM, question classification, and other nodes. Workflow has no Memory-related configuration and cannot be enabled.
4. Chatflow's start node built-in variables include: `sys.query`, `sys.files`, `sys.conversation_id`, `sys.user_id`. Workflow's start node built-in variables include: `sys.files`, `sys.user_id`
