title: Outputting Logs for Development and Debugging
---

As a plugin developer, you may want to print arbitrary strings to logs during plugin processing for development or debugging purposes.

For this purpose, the plugin SDK implements a handler for Python's standard `logging` library. By using this, you can output any string to both the **standard output during remote debugging** and the **plugin daemon container logs** (community edition only).

## Sample

Import `plugin_logger_handler` and add it to your logger as a handler. Below is a sample code for a tool plugin.

```python
from collections.abc import Generator
from typing import Any
from dify_plugin import Tool
from dify_plugin.entities.tool import ToolInvokeMessage


# Import logging and custom handler
import logging
from dify_plugin.config.logger_format import plugin_logger_handler

# Set up logging with the custom handler
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
logger.addHandler(plugin_logger_handler)


class LoggerDemoTool(Tool):
    def _invoke(self, tool_parameters: dict[str, Any]) -> Generator[ToolInvokeMessage]:

        # Log messages with different severity levels
        logger.info("This is a INFO log message.")
        logger.warning("This is a WARNING log message.")
        logger.error("This is a ERROR log message.")

        yield self.create_text_message("Hello, Dify!")
```
