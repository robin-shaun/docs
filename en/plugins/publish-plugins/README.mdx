### Publish Methods

To accommodate the various publishing needs of developers, Dify provides three plugin publish methods:

#### **1. Marketplace**

**Introduction**: The official Dify plugin marketplace allows users to browse, search, and install a variety of plugins with just one click.

**Features**:

* Plugins become available after passing a review, ensuring they are **trustworthy** and **high-quality**.
* Can be installed directly into an individual or team **Workspaces**.

**Publication Process**:

* Submit the plugin project to the **Dify Marketplace** [code repository](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugins).
* After an official review, the plugin will be publicly released in the marketplace for other users to install and use.

* Users can install the plugin directly via a link, bypassing platform review.

**Publication Process**:

* Suitable for **private plugins** or **internal testing**.

### **Publication Recommendations**

* **Looking to promote a plugin** → **Recommended to use the Marketplace**, ensuring plugin quality through official review and increasing exposure.
* **Open-source sharing project** → **Recommended to use GitHub**, convenient for version management and community collaboration.
* **Quick distribution or internal testing** → **Recommended to use plugin file**, allowing for straightforward and efficient installation and sharing.

> When installing plugins that are not from the Dify Marketplace, you may encounter third-party signature verification issues. For solutions, please refer to [Signing Plugins for Third-Party Signature Verification](./signing-plugins-for-third-party-signature-verification.mdx).
