title: Deploy Dify Docs MCP Service and Chat with Documentation
description: Learn how to deploy a local documentation MCP server and chat with documentation using AI.
---

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard protocol developed by Anthropic that provides standardized protocol for AI models to interact with external tools and data sources. AI models can access software tools and data resources through this protocol.

This article explains how to deploy a local MCP server based on the [dify-docs-mintlify repository](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-docs-mintlify) to enable natural conversations between LLMs and documentation.

<Info>
    For detailed information about the MCP protocol, please refer to [Model Context Protocol](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp).

<Accordion title="How It Works">

When the AI model receives a query, it analyzes the required concepts and technical details. If the knowledge of Dify is related, the model automatically generates retrieval queries.

It will generates appropriate search keywords and query strategies based on the question's nature. For queries like "How to integrate OpenAI GPT-4 model in Dify", the model generates searches for "model configuration", "API integration", "GPT-4 setup", and other relevant terms to ensure comprehensive information retrieval.

Once the MCP server receives these queries, it searches the Dify documentation library and returns relevant content. The model then integrates this information to generate accurate and detailed responses.

This process supports multiple rounds of interactive queries, with the system adjusting subsequent search strategies based on initial results.

## Prerequisites

- Node ≥ 16.0
- Git
- MCP client (such as Claude Desktop, VS Code, etc.)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone Repository

Clone the Dify documentation repository locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langgenius/dify-docs-mintlify.git
```

This repository serves as the data source for the MCP server.

### 2. Initialize MCP Server

Navigate to the documentation directory and install the MCP server:

```bash
cd dify-docs-mintlify
npx mint-mcp add dify-6c0370d8
```

This command performs the following operations:
- Creates a local MCP server instance
- Analyzes and indexes documentation content
- Configures necessary dependencies

The installation process takes a few minutes, depending on your network connection.

### 3. Configure MCP Server

<Info>
    **MCP Client and Server Relationship:**
    
    MCP servers provide knowledge and tools by handling query requests, managing data resources, and executing specific functions. Clients serve as user interaction interfaces—typically AI applications or chat tools—that receive user questions, forward queries to appropriate MCP servers, and integrate the information before returning responses to users.
</Info>

During installation, you'll be prompted to select an MCP client. **Using Claude Desktop as an example**, the tool will generate the corresponding configuration information.

Once installation is complete, add the MCP server in Claude Desktop settings. Navigate to the settings page, add the server address and port in the MCP server configuration section, save the configuration, and restart the application.

## Conversing with Documentation

After configuration is complete, you can begin conversing with the Dify documentation. This approach supports natural language queries without requiring page-by-page searching or precise keyword matching.

For instance, when asking "I want to create a customer service chatbot—should I choose Workflow or Chatflow?", the system explains the differences between these two application types and provides specific recommendations tailored to customer service scenarios.

For technical questions like "How do I modify the Dify port number?", the AI model provides specific operational steps:

The MCP approach allows you to describe problems in natural language. Even when you're uncertain about specific technical terminology, you can simply describe the desired outcome to obtain relevant information.

## Comparison with RAG Methods

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pre-chunks documents into text chunks and uses vector embeddings to build indexes. When users ask questions, the system calculates similarity between the question and text chunks, selecting the most relevant chunks as context for generating answers.

**RAG advantages:** Fast processing speed, well-suited for large-scale static document.

**RAG limitations:**

- Static document chunking may scatter related information across different chunks
- Vector similarity-based retrieval may miss semantically related content with different vocabulary
- Context window limitations restrict answers to specific fragments only

The MCP method adopts a dynamic and flexible approach. AI models proactively generate query strategies based on question requirements, support multiple rounds of interactive queries, and adjust subsequent searches based on initial results.

**MCP advantages:**
- Access to complete document content, enabling complex cross-chapter queries
- Real-time queries reflect document updates, ensuring information currency
- Delivers coherent and comprehensive answers
