title: Publish as a Single-page Web App
---

One of the benefits of creating AI applications with Dify is that you can publish a Single-page AI web app accessible to all users on the internet within minutes.

* If you're using the self-hosted open-source version, the application will run on your server
* If you're using the cloud service, the application will be hosted at [https://udify.app/](https://udify.app/).

### Publishing an AI Website

Toggle the **"In service / Disabled"** switch, your Web App URL will be effective immediately publicly shared on the internet.
