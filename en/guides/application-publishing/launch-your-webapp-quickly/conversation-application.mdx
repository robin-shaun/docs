title: Conversation Application
---


Conversational applications engage in continuous dialogue with users in a question-and-answer format. These applications support the following features (ensure these functions are enabled during application orchestration):

* Variables filled out before the conversation.
* Creation, pinning, and deletion of conversations.
* Conversation opening statements.
* Next step question suggestions.
* Speech-to-text.
* References and attributions.

### Variables Filled Out Before the Conversation

If you have set variable filling requirements during application orchestration, you will need to fill out the prompted information before entering the conversation window:

Fill in the necessary details and click the "Start Conversation" button to begin chatting. Hover over the AI's response to copy the conversation content, and provide "like" or "dislike" feedback.

### Conversation Opener

If the "Conversation Opener" feature is enabled on the application orchestration page, the AI application will automatically initiate the first line of dialogue when a new conversation is created.

### Follow Up

If the "Follow-up" feature is enabled on the application orchestration page, the system will automatically generate 3 relevant question suggestions after the conversation:

### Speech-to-Text

If the "Speech-to-Text" feature is enabled during application orchestration, you will see a speech input icon in the input box of the web application. Click the icon to convert speech to text:

_Please ensure that your device environment is authorized to use the microphone._

### References and Attributions

When testing the knowledge base effect within the application, you can go to **Workspace -- Add Function -- Citation and Attribution** to enable the citation attribution feature. For detailed instructions, please refer to [Citation and Attribution](/en/guides/knowledge-base/retrieval-test-and-citation).
