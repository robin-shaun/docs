title: Debug Nodes
---

Workflow and Chatflow applications typically consist of multiple interconnected nodes. To ensure your entire application runs smoothly, you need to verify each node's inputs and outputs meet expectations. The debugging feature helps developers confirm the application functions as designed, identify potential issues early, and prevent errors in production environments.

You can debug nodes using two methods:

## Step Debugging

Step debugging lets you test specific nodes independently without executing the entire workflow. This is useful when adding new nodes, troubleshooting specific errors, or testing how nodes handle different inputs.

### How to Step Debug

1. Select the node you want to debug in the workflow editor
2. Click the **Run Step** button in the top right corner of the node
3. Enter the required input variables in the debug panel
4. Click Execute to run the node
5. Review the output results and execution status

For example, if you've added an HTTP node and want to verify it correctly retrieves API responses, you can use step debugging to test the node's behavior without affecting downstream nodes.

After debugging, you'll see the node's execution status, input/output data, and metadata. If errors occur, you can quickly troubleshoot using the error messages, preventing individual node failures from causing application-wide issues.

<Warning>
    Answer and End nodes don't support step debugging.

## Sequential Execution

Sequential execution works best for testing interdependent nodes, especially when a node requires output from upstream nodes. Unlike step debugging, this method starts from the initial node and follows the workflow path sequentially until reaching your specified target node.

### How to Run Sequentially

1. Select your target endpoint node in the workflow editor
2. Click the **Run To** button in the top right corner of the node
3. The system will execute all nodes in sequence from the start until reaching your target node
4. After execution, you can examine each node's status and output results

For example, if your workflow contains data retrieval (Node A) → data processing (Node B) → result display (Node C), and Node B depends on Node A's output, you can select Node B and click "Run To". The system will execute Node A first, then Node B, allowing you to verify data flows correctly between them.

During sequential execution, you can observe the partial workflow in action and make adjustments to configurations, data flow, and processing logic based on the results.

<Warning>
    Sequential execution isn't supported for nodes with multiple branches, such as question classification nodes and condition nodes.
</Warning>

## View Node Execution Records

Each node generates logs after execution. You can click **Last Run** in the node details page to view the execution history.
