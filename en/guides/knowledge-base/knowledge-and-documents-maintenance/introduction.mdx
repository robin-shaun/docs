</Info>

Click the **Knowledge** button at the top of the Dify platform and select the knowledge you want to manage. Navigate to Settings in the left sidebar to configure it.

Here, you can modify the knowledge base's name, description, permissions, indexing method, embedding model and retrieval settings.

* **Knowledge Name**: Used to distinguish among different knowledge bases.
* **Knowledge Description**: Used to describe the information represented by the documents in the knowledge base.
* **Permission**: Defines access control for the knowledge base with three levels:
  * **"Only Me"**: Restricts access to the knowledge base owner.
  * **"All team members"**: Grants access to every member of the team.
  * **"Partial team members"**: Allows selective access to specific team members.
  
    Users without appropriate permissions cannot access the knowledge base. When granting access to team members (Options 2 or 3), authorized users are granted full permissions, including the ability to view, edit, and delete knowledge base content.

* **Indexing Mode**: For detailed explanations, please refer to the [documentation](/en/guides/knowledge-base/create-knowledge-and-upload-documents/setting-indexing-methods).
* **Embedding Model**: Allows you to modify the embedding model for the knowledge base. Changing the embedding model will re-embed all documents in the knowledge base, and the original embeddings will be deleted.
* **Retrieval Settings**: For detailed explanations, please refer to the [documentation](/en/learn-more/extended-reading/retrieval-augment/retrieval).
