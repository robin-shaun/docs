title: Text Generation Application
---

A text generation application is a type of application specifically designed to produce content in specific formats. These applications allow users to input specific requirements or parameters and automatically generate text output that conforms to preset formats. Unlike chat assistants that can maintain continuous conversations, text generation applications primarily process single inputs to provide one-time content generation services, with "Prompt Generator" being a typical example.

## Use Cases

Text generation applications are particularly suitable for scenarios requiring quick, batch generation of standardized content, such as creative writing, marketing copy, or technical documentation.

## How to Configure

Text generation applications support configuration of: pre-conversation prompts, variables, context, opening messages, and suggested follow-up questions.

Let's take creating a **Weekly Report Generator** application as an example to explain how to configure a text generation application.

### Creating the Application

Click the "Create Application" button on the homepage to create an application. Enter the application name and select **Text Generation Application** as the application type.

### Configuring the Application

After creating the application, you'll automatically be redirected to the application overview page, where you can set variables, add context, and configure additional chat features for the application.

#### Application Configuration

**Writing Prompts**

Prompts are used to constrain AI responses to be professional and precise. You can use the built-in prompt generator to write appropriate prompts. Prompts support the insertion of form variables, such as `{{input}}`. The values of variables in the prompt will be replaced with user-entered values.

Example:
1. Enter prompt instructions requesting a prompt for an interview scenario.
2. The right content box will automatically generate the prompt.
3. You can insert custom variables into the prompt.

#### Adding Context

If you want to limit AI conversations to within a knowledge base, such as enterprise customer service conversation standards, you can reference the knowledge base in the "Context" section.

### Debugging

Fill in the user input fields on the right side and enter content for debugging.

If the response results are not satisfactory, you can adjust the prompts and underlying model. You can also debug simultaneously with multiple models to find the most suitable configuration.

**Debugging with Multiple Models:**

If debugging with a single model feels inefficient, you can use the **"Debug with Multiple Models"** feature to batch review model response effects.

Supports adding up to 4 large models simultaneously.

⚠️ When using the multi-model debugging feature, if you only see some large models, this is because Keys for other large models haven't been added yet. You can manually add Keys for multiple models in "Add New Provider".

### Publishing the Application

After debugging the application, click the **"Publish"** button in the top right corner to generate a standalone AI application. In addition to experiencing the application through a public URL, you can also perform secondary development based on APIs or embed it into websites. For details, please refer to [Publishing Applications](/en/guides/application-publishing/launch-your-webapp-quickly/web-app-settings).

If you want to customize a published application, you can fork our open-source WebApp template and modify it to meet your scenario and style requirements.
