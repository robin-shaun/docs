title: Start
---

#### Definition

The **“Start”** node is a critical preset node in the [Chatflow / Workflow](../) application. It provides essential initial information, such as user input and [uploaded files](/en-us/user-guide/build-app/flow-app/file-upload), to support the normal flow of the application and subsequent workflow nodes.

#### Configuring the Node

On the Start node's settings page, you'll find two sections: **"Input Fields"** and preset **[System Variables](/en-us/user-guide/build-app/flow-app/variables#system-variables)**.

#### Input Field

Input field is configured by application developers to prompt users for additional information.

For example, in a weekly report application, users might be required to provide background information such as name, work date range, and work details in a specific format. This preliminary information helps the LLM generate higher quality responses.

Six types of input variables are supported, all of which can be set as required:

* **Text:** Short text, filled in by the user, with a maximum length of 256 characters.
* **Paragraph:** Long text, allowing users to input longer content.
* **Select:** Fixed options set by the developer; users can only select from preset options and cannot input custom content.
* **Number:** Only allows numerical input.
* **Single File:** Allows users to upload a single file. Supports document types, images, audio, video, and other file types. Users can upload locally or paste a file URL. For detailed usage, refer to [File Upload](/en-us/user-guide/build-app/flow-app/file-upload).
* **File List:** Allows users to batch upload files. Supports document types, images, audio, video, and other file types. Users can upload locally or paste file URLs. For detailed usage, refer to [File Upload](/en-us/user-guide/build-app/flow-app/file-upload).


<Note>Dify's built-in document extractor node can only process certain document formats. For processing images, audio, or video files, refer to External Data Tools to set up corresponding file processing nodes.</Note>

Once configured, users will be guided to provide necessary information to the LLM before using the application. More information will help to improve the LLM's question-answering efficiency.

### System Variables

System variables are system-level parameters preset in Chatflow / Workflow applications that can be globally read by other nodes within the application. They are typically used in advanced development scenarios, such as building multi-round conversation applications, collecting application logs and monitoring, and recording usage behavior across different applications and users.

**Workflow**

Workflow type applications provide the following system variables:

| Variable Name | Data Type | Description | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|------|
| `sys.files` [LEGACY] | Array[File] | File parameter, stores images uploaded by users when initially using the application | Image upload feature needs to be enabled in "Features" at the top right of the application configuration page |
| `sys.user_id` | String | User ID, system automatically assigns a unique identifier to each user when using the workflow application to distinguish different conversation users | |
| `sys.app_id` | String | Application ID, system assigns a unique identifier to each Workflow application to distinguish different applications and record basic information of the current application through this parameter | For users with development capabilities to distinguish and locate different Workflow applications using this parameter |
| `sys.workflow_id` | String | Workflow ID, used to record all node information contained in the current Workflow application | For users with development capabilities to track and record node information within the Workflow |
| `sys.workflow_run_id` | String | Workflow application run ID, used to record the running status of the Workflow application | For users with development capabilities to track application run history |

**Chatflow**

Chatflow type applications provide the following system variables:

| Variable Name | Data Type | Description | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|------|
| `sys.query` | String | Initial content entered by users in the dialogue box | |
| `sys.files` | Array[File] | Images uploaded by users in the dialogue box | Image upload feature needs to be enabled in "Features" at the top right of the application configuration page |
| `sys.dialogue_count` | Number | Number of conversation rounds when users interact with Chatflow type applications. Count automatically increases by 1 after each round of dialogue, can be combined with if-else nodes for rich branching logic. For example, reviewing and analyzing conversation history at round X | |
| `sys.conversation_id` | String | Unique identifier for dialogue interaction sessions, grouping all related messages into the same conversation, ensuring LLM maintains continuous dialogue on the same topic and context | |
| `sys.user_id` | String | Unique identifier assigned to each application user to distinguish different conversation users | |
| `sys.app_id` | String | Application ID, system assigns a unique identifier to each Workflow application to distinguish different applications and record basic information of the current application through this parameter | For users with development capabilities to distinguish and locate different Workflow applications using this parameter |
| `sys.workflow_id` | String | Workflow ID, used to record all node information contained in the current Workflow application | For users with development capabilities to track and record node information within the Workflow |
| `sys.workflow_run_id` | String | Workflow application run ID, used to record the running status of the Workflow application | For users with development capabilities to track application run history |
