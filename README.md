# 📘 Dify Documentation (Mintlify Edition)

Welcome to the new documentation repository for **Dify**, currently in migration from the original [`dify-docs`](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-docs) repo.

> 🚧 This is a **work-in-progress** version of the official Dify docs.  
> You can preview the site at: [https://docs.dify.dev](https://docs.dify.dev/en/introduction)  
> Once finalized, the docs will be moved to [https://docs.dify.ai](https://docs.dify.ai) and fully replace the old documentation site.

We warmly welcome your contributions — whether it's proofreading, fixing typos, or submitting new content. Please feel free to open issues or PRs if you find anything that could be improved!
