description: Introduction to the basic concepts and structure of model plugins. Model
  plugins allow Dify to call various models from different providers (such as OpenAI,
  Anthropic, Google, etc.), including large language models (LLMs), text embeddings,
  speech-to-text, and other types.
---

Model plugins enable the Dify platform to call all LLMs from a specific model provider. For example, after installing the OpenAI model plugin, the Dify platform can call models provided by OpenAI such as `GPT-4`, `GPT-4o-2024-05-13`, etc.

## Model Plugin Structure

To facilitate understanding the concepts involved in developing model plugins, here is a brief introduction to the structure within model plugins:

-   **Model Provider**: Companies that develop large models, such as **OpenAI, Anthropic, Google**, etc.
-   **Model Categories**: Depending on the model provider, there are categories like Large Language Models (LLM), Text Embedding models, Speech-to-Text models, etc.
-   **Specific Models**: `claude-3-5-sonnet`, `gpt-4-turbo`, etc.

Code hierarchy structure in plugin projects:

```bash
- Model Provider
    - Model Category
        - Specific Models
```

Taking **Anthropic** as an example, the model plugin structure looks like this:

```bash
- Anthropic
    - llm
        claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
        claude-3-haiku-20240307
        claude-3-opus-20240229
        claude-3-sonnet-20240229
        claude-instant-1.2
        claude-instant-1
```

Taking OpenAI as an example, since it supports multiple model types, there are multiple model categories, structured as follows:

```bash
├── models
│   ├── llm
│   │   ├── chatgpt-4o-latest
│   │   ├── gpt-3.5-turbo
│   │   ├── gpt-4-0125-preview
│   │   ├── gpt-4-turbo
│   │   ├── gpt-4o
│   │   ├── llm
│   │   ├── o1-preview
│   │   └── text-davinci-003
│   ├── moderation
│   │   ├── moderation
│   │   └── text-moderation-stable
│   ├── speech2text
│   │   ├── speech2text
│   │   └── whisper-1
│   ├── text_embedding
│   │   ├── text-embedding-3-large
│   │   └── text_embedding
│   └── tts
│       ├── tts-1-hd
│       ├── tts-1
│       └── tts
```

## Model Configuration

Model plugins define model behavior and properties through configuration files. For detailed model design rules and configuration formats, please refer to the [Model Design Rules](/plugin_dev_en/0411-model-designing-rules.en) document and [Model Schema](/plugin_dev_en/0412-model-schema.en) specifications.
