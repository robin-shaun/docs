  project as a local file and share it with others. It covers the preparation work

After completing plugin development, you can package the plugin project as a local file and share it with others. After obtaining the plugin file, it can be installed into a Dify Workspace. If you haven't developed a plugin yet, you can refer to the [Plugin Development: Hello World Guide](/plugin_dev_en/0211-getting-started-dify-tool).

* **Features**:
  * Not dependent on online platforms, **quick and flexible** way to share plugins.
  * Suitable for **private plugins** or **internal testing**.
* **Publishing Process**:
  * Package the plugin project as a local file.
  * Upload the file on the Dify plugins page to install the plugin.

This article will introduce how to package a plugin project as a local file and how to install a plugin using a local file.

### Prerequisites

* **Dify Plugin Development Tool**, for detailed instructions, please refer to [Initializing Development Tools](/plugin_dev_en/0221-initialize-development-tools).

After configuration, enter the `dify version` command in the terminal to check if it outputs version information to confirm that the necessary development tools have been installed.

### Packaging the Plugin

> Before packaging the plugin, please ensure that the `author` field in the plugin's `manifest.yaml` file and the `.yaml` file under the `/provider` path is consistent with your GitHub ID. For detailed information about the manifest file, please refer to [General Specifications](/plugin_dev_en/0411-general-specifications).

After completing the plugin project development, make sure you have completed the [remote debugging test](/plugin_dev_en/0411-remote-debug-a-plugin). Navigate to the directory above your plugin project and run the following plugin packaging command:

```bash
dify plugin package ./your_plugin_project
```

After running the command, a file with the `.difypkg` extension will be generated in the current path.

### Publishing the Plugin

You can share the plugin file with others or upload it to the internet for others to download. If you want to share your plugin more widely, you can consider:

1. [Publish to Individual GitHub Repository](/plugin_dev_en/0322-release-to-individual-github-repo) - Share the plugin through GitHub
2. [Publish to Dify Marketplace](/plugin_dev_en/0322-release-to-dify-marketplace) - Publish the plugin on the official marketplace
