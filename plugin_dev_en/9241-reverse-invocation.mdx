title: Reverse Invocation of Dify Services
description: This document briefly introduces the reverse invocation capability of
  Dify plugins, meaning plugins can call specified services within the main Dify platform.
  It lists four types of modules that can be invoked, App (access App data), Model
  (call model capabilities within the platform), Tool (call other tool plugins within
  the platform), and Node (call nodes within a Chatflow/Workflow application).
---

Plugins can freely call some services within the main Dify platform to enhance their capabilities.

### Callable Dify Modules

*   [App](/plugin_dev_en/9242-reverse-invocation-app.mdx)

    Plugins can access data from Apps within the Dify platform.
*   [Model](/plugin_dev_en/9242-reverse-invocation-model.mdx)

    Plugins can reverse invoke LLM capabilities within the Dify platform, including all model types and functions within the platform, such as TTS, Rerank, etc.
*   [Tool](/plugin_dev_en/9242-reverse-invocation-tool.mdx)

    Plugins can call other tool-type plugins within the Dify platform.
