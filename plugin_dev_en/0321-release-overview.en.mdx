### Publishing Methods

To meet the publishing needs of different developers, Dify provides the following three plugin publishing methods. Before publishing, please ensure that you have completed the development and testing of your plugin, and have read [Basic Concepts of Plugin Development](/plugin_dev_en/0111-getting-started-dify-plugin.en) and [Plugin Developer Guidelines](/plugin_dev_en/0313-contributor-covenant-code-of-conduct.en).

#### **1. Marketplace**

**Introduction**: The official plugin marketplace provided by Dify, where users can browse, search, and install various plugins with one click.

**Features**:

* Plugins are reviewed before going online, ensuring they are **safe and reliable**.
* Can be directly installed in personal or team **Workspaces**.

**Publishing Process**:

* Submit the plugin project to the **Dify Marketplace** [code repository](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugins).
* After official review, the plugin will be publicly available in the marketplace for other users to install and use.

For detailed instructions, please refer to:

#### 2. **GitHub Repository**

**Introduction**: Open-source or host your plugin on **GitHub** for others to view, download, and install.

**Features**:

* Convenient for **version management** and **open-source sharing**.
* Users can install directly via the plugin link, without platform review.

**Publishing Process**:

* Push the plugin code to a GitHub repository.
* Share the repository link, users can integrate the plugin into their **Dify Workspace** through the link.

For detailed instructions, please refer to:

#### 3. Plugin File Package (Local Installation)

**Introduction**: Package the plugin as a local file (such as `.difypkg` format) and share it for others to install.

**Features**:

* Not dependent on online platforms, **quick and flexible** way to share plugins.
* Suitable for **private plugins** or **internal testing**.

**Publishing Process**:

You can package your plugin project as a local file and share it with others. After uploading the file on the plugins page, you can install the plugin into your Dify Workspace.
